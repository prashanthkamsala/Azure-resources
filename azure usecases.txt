                           AZURE REALTIME PROJECTS or USECASES

Vitual Machines:

> My client, Nokia needs a windows Vm for Data storage. so launch a vm with 3 additional disk.
  Disk capacities should be 10gb, 7gb & 5gb. Duplicate the data of 5gb disk into 8gb disk of second 
  vm. In that vm, enable remote and web service from anywhere. Also make the second server can reach 
  any destinantion point.

> My client needs a webserver with separate disk for os & data storage. webpage sources should be stored
  under the data disk. webserver should be accessed by a static public ip. also they needa a backup for   
  this webserver and ensure at any situation they can switch thier webserver to any location.

AZURE IAM:

> My client, swiggy wants to administrate thier technical engineers as follows. They have team such as
  developers, database eng., linux admins and system admins. All the teams should be in two levels like
  L1 & L2.

> During Cab call we confirmed with SDM manager, thier requirement is to have a "Team leaders" group to 
  manage all the teams. Ensure only Team Leaders group can do this user management.

> My client need common file repo, everyone can access that file repository.

STORAGE ACCOUNT:

> My Client, needs two common storage places to store Files & Folders. One container it can access by Public
  end-users, & storage admins. Another common storage place should accessible privately by the azure vms only.
  Both the containers should control by policies to grant access. one container should not overwrite any file  
  at any time and container.

VNETS:

> My client, TVs wants to launch thier websites publicly along with its database servers at the backend. Establish n/w
  connectivity b/w webservers and database servers. 
NOTE: No need of public access for database servers ensure only website can access from public network.

> My client wants to 2 different n/w in 2 different regions. In 1 n/w, both sub n/ws should have internet access but, in 
  another n/ws, one sub networks should have internet access other sub n/ws should not have internet access.
  Establish n/w connectivity b/w 2 diff n/ws.

> My client need a n/w, in that n/w they are going to host only database servers, so they dont want expose those servers
  in public network directly. Also they want to reduce the usage of public IPs. Give solutions to implement the n/w with
  obove requirement.

LOAD BALANCER:

> My client needs a web service should run with high availability and access publicly with below requirements,
 (public LB)
  > 1 VNET with 2 subnets.
  > VMs configured with apache website.
  > HTTP port should be opened.
  > Health check TCP 80.

> My client requirement is run webservice with high availability, and client should not access website publicly (private LB).

VM SCALE SET:

> My client wants to webservice with automatic redundancy, if cpu utilization increase above 80%, it should increase by 2 servers, if CPU
  utilization decrease below 80%,it should decrease by 2 servers, the servers are scale out and scale in automatically. During scale out and 
  scale In, Monitoring team should get alerts via Email notification.

DNS:

> In my client environment more than 100 servers are from same VNet. They wanted to have same DNS IP for all server. Majorly client they have 
  centralized DNS private zone where they have all of thier records. whatever the record they have it in the private zone it should be resolved
