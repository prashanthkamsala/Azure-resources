# Azure-resources
Azure is a cloud computing platform from Microsoft that provides a range of services for building, deploying, and managing applications and infrastructure. It offers a wide range of services, including compute, storage, networking, and machine learning, as well as tools for developing, deploying, and managing applications. Azure is designed to be scalable, flexible, and secure, making it an ideal platform for a variety of workloads and applications.
In the context of a README file, mentioning Azure can provide useful information to users about the platform that the project is built on and any required Azure resources. For example, if the project requires specific Azure services or resources, such as virtual machines or storage accounts, this information can be included in the Repo. Additionally, providing an overview of Azure and its capabilities can help users understand the benefits of using the platform and how it can support their project.
